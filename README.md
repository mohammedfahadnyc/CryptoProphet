# CryptoProphet
This is a project Created for HackUIOWA hackathon.
In this project, I have extracted past 5 years crypto currency data upto the hackathon date(04/18/2021)from yahoo finance and created data visualization of those crypto market data. I have created box plot,graph area and candlestick for all the major cryptocurrency and then used facebook Prophet to predict price of Dogecoin for next 30 days. This model can be revised to predict any crypto data as well. I also compare the past predictions and compare with the actual values.
Language : Python
Tools used : Google Colab, Plotly Express, Pandas, Facebook PROPHET, Google Sheets
